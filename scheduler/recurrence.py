# scheduler/recurrence.py
"""
Minimal recurrence helpers for an AI scheduler.

This module is OPTIONAL. Your current app.py works without it.
Use these helpers only when you want more advanced recurrence
(such as "first Friday of each month", "every 2 weeks", etc).

All functions return a list[date] for the *dates* on which
events should occur. You can then attach times/durations in app.py.
